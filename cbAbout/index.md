#About Me:
____________________________________

My name is Austin Miller, I've been building computers for over a decade. Large budget or small I'd love to build one for you too.

#Why Pick me over someone else:

I perosnally promise that I will deliver to you the best computer for you no matter your situation or budget. I won't make stupid compromises just so I can max your budget [Not like These guys](http://www.bestbuy.com/site/ibuypower-desktop-amd-fx-series-8gb-memory-500gb-hard-drive-black-blue/6980021.p?id=1218818471270&skuId=6980021) building "Gaming" computers with a strong processor and weak video-card. 

Don't have a large budget, thats okay! I can almost always provide a great computer foundation for almost any budgetallowing you for easy upgrades down the road.

I'm a local guy, and I'm pretty chill. 

#The Gurantee:

I guarantee all labor peformed for 1 year.
