#About Me, the site and my Projects
____________________________________


My name is Austin Miller, I'm a student at the University of Texas at Arlington. 

##Personal Life:
	
I am a student at the University of Texas at Arlington pursing a B.S. in Information Systems, my expected graduation is May 2016. 


##Programming:

 Since I was I've flirted with various languages, VB.net,VB,Ruby,PHP,C++ to name a few, and I was terrible. I also hated it. It wasn't until I started learning Python that programming concepts started falling into place. Through I've picked up some great entry-level/beginner experience with Java application development, multi-threading, GUI support and implementation, database support and management via Derby, and some third party libraries I've taught myself like JSoup. In  late-December/early-January I started working with Android from the development side, self-taught the process was slow going, but if you look   [here]("http://lamewifi.net/blog/myFirstApp/") you can see the first app I created. 

##My Goals:

I'd like to be able to pursue a career in software development, be it mobile app development or more traditional desktop applications, although I do prefer android development far beyond traditional java development. I love the challenge and reward the programming brings, the possibility of getting paid to do something I enjoy so much would be such a thrill.
