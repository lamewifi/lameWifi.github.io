##The Why:

I’m a gamer myself, I know what components to look for to ensure you get the best expereince for your budget. Whether that means helping to upgrade your old machine, or building an entierly new machine. I’ll shoot you straight in terms of expectations not like [some of the other guys]("http://www.bestbuy.com/site/ibuypower-desktop-amd-fx-series-8gb-memory-500gb-hard-drive-black-blue/6980021.p?id=1218818471270&amp;skuId=6980021)

##The Difference:

All of the computers I build use quality components to ensure future upgradability and durability. All pre-select builds use at least  500W 80+ certified Power supplies, 6GB of RAM and thick steel cases.

##The Guy:

My name is Austin Miller, I’ve been building computers for over a decade. Doesn’t matter if your budget is large or small I can build one for you too.
Be it one of the preselect builds, complete [custom] to match your needs or helping you upgrade your current machine.</p>

##The Gurantee:

I guarantee all labor peformed for 1 year.
